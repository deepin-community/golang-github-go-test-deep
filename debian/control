Description: Golang deep variable equality test that returns human-readable differences
 Deep Variable Equality for Humans.
 .
 This package provides a single function: deep.Equal. It's like
 reflect.DeepEqual (http://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#DeepEqual) but
 much friendlier to humans (or any sentient being) for two reason:
  • deep.Equal returns a list of differences
  • deep.Equal does not compare unexported fields (by default)
